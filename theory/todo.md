# Partial TODO list for theory writeup

This is just a scratchpad for me to write down things I think of while writing.

- Add illustrations everywhere
- Extra: explain heat capacities
- Extra: derive isentropic relations
- Extra: Derive quasi-1D conservation equations from 3D integral equations
- Shock relations
